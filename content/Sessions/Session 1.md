We first traveled to a small fishing village just below [[Ulm Edhil]] where we met [[Sanne]] the death cleric. He was looking for a job and found one for a lost Teddy Bear for a girl named Annie. After wandering around the town and finding no leads and getting to know some of the townspeople Sanne went to his room that night to write in a journal and the skeleton on the front of his shield talked to him and asked him to join his campaign through the promise of gold and always having a job. He left with [[Lorelai]] in search of more companions. They left for the town of [[Thanlion]] where we watched [[Vatrix]] plan his subsequent burning. He planned the guards routes and found a back way in so that he was undetected. He was interrupted by Lorelai and Sanne and was recruited on the spot. With the help of Lorelai and Sanne he burned down the warehouse and left his calling card before leaving that night. They then headed out for [[Middlesborough]] where we met [[Rhys Gieseherr]] who was working a factory job and was tired of his coworkers giving him side eye for what he had done. He was then visited by [[Prince Baelin]] in his dreams and was recruited into the cause by being promised money, benefits, and being in charge. After that they left for the [[Outer Wilds]] in search of their final member. [[Yygmit]] was thrown out of his temple / grove for studying the spores that had infected him before arriving. He was wandering around the outer wilds when he ran into a small hamlet and stole a pie because he was hungry. A villager caught him and he threw the pie at him and escaped, on his way out he decided to infect the well and some of the children got sick. He left the hamlet and found an alcove with some mushrooms. He ate the mushrooms and had a serious trip all while Prince Baelin spoke to him and recruited him by asking him if he wanted to start his own circle. He agreed and the party found him the next morning all while the headed north.
